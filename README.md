Provided tailored investment consultation to Mr. Patrick Jyenger and Mr. Peter Jyenger, aligning with their unique financial objectives and risk tolerances, to optimize their portfolio performance and achieve their long-term financial goals.

Data Cleaning with Python:
- Employed Python for systematic data cleaning and preprocessing, identifying 411 null values in FB_close and FB_volume data fields.
- Concluded that the missing data was non-random, attributed to Facebook's stock listing on May 18, 2012, and subsequently imputed null values with zeros for further analysis.
- Performed outlier analysis on the dataset to detect and assess data points exhibiting substantial deviations from the general pattern

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Utilized diverse calculations such as daily and cumulative returns, Sharpe ratios, portfolio risk, and ROI for thorough analysis of stock data.
- Identified top-performing stocks for different portfolios based on a rigorous assessment of performance metrics.
- Utilized Python libraries including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization purposes.

Key Insights from Data Analysis:
- Half of the stocks, specifically 13 out of 26, are exhibiting positive cumulative returns, implying that the remaining half are generating losses.
- Seven stocks are surpassing the performance of the market index S&P500, albeit with a slightly elevated level of risk.
- AMZN (1.32), MSFT (1.23), and AAPL (1.10) showcase positive Sharpe ratios exceeding 1, signifying that these stocks have provided returns surpassing the risk-free rate in proportion to the level of risk assumed.


** This project delved into stock prices across various sectors, analyzing historical data and trading volumes for each stock. We explored daily returns and correlations, with Microsoft and Amazon showing notable correlations. We observed a maximum of 8% daily price fluctuation and highlighted the importance of understanding market dynamics to manage risks. Identifying stocks with favorable risk-return profiles, Amazon emerged as high risk and high return. Ultimately, our analysis facilitated the provision of tailored portfolios for two clients, aligning with their financial objectives and risk tolerance.**
